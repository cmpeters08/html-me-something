<p>
Hello! Thank you for viewing my r&eacute;sum&eacute;. This r&eacute;sum&eacute; was made for as an assignment for the Immersive CodeCamp offered by LaunchCode.<br>
When you are looking for someone to be a part of your team, it's hard to get a good feel for them just by reading their academic achievements and recent work history. That's why I've included this section, so you can get a better impression of who I am. 
Hobbies, every well rounded person has a hobby. My most recent hobby is the St. Louis Renaissance Festival where I make candles in the Scottish Guild. 
</p>
<p>
When I'm not living in the 16th century I enjoy rock climbing, crochet, practicing yoga, and traveling. My favorite travel destination so far is Ireland. Ireland is a beautiful country, and I cannot wait until I can visit again.
My favorite part about traveling is meeting new people and being immersed in different cultures. 
I try to expand my worldview at home as well by learning new languages through the <a href="www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a> app. 
Right now I'm working on German and Swedish, I'm hoping to be fluent in both in a few years. 
<br>
There's really not much more to know about me. If you think I might be a good fit for your team feel free to <a href="cmpeters08@gmail.com">contact me</a>.
